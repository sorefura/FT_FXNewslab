# Data and Versioning

## Production Strategy identity and Paper evidence target

Milestone 2-A adds content-addressed Strategy config, operational Swap evidence,
entry evaluation, production Candidate, and ordinary close Candidate contracts in
code without adding persistence. Existing Live migrations remain `0001` and `0002`.
Milestone 2-B/C/D may add Strategy persistence using the next available additive
numbers in implementation order. Paper persistence begins at the next available
additive Live migration only after Milestone 2 production Strategy persistence is
complete; `0003` is not reserved.

Milestone 2-B1 added no migration and changed no SQLite behavior. It defines the
content-addressed evidence that M2-B2 through M2-B4 persist in stages:

```text
PairSignalMaterializationSpecification
PairSignalMaterializationRequest
SignalContentSnapshot
PairSignalSelectionCandidate inventory
PairSignalSelectionSnapshot
Pair Signal deterministic identity
PairSignalDerivation
```

The Specification includes every source/output Signal, Pair, Horizon, version,
freshness, exact-Observation-group, and selection-policy dimension. Duration identity
uses integer microseconds. One Request is exactly Pair/as-of/Specification; selected
Signal IDs, checkpoint, candidate count, audit capture/materialization time, worker,
and retry attempt are excluded so retry cannot create another semantic request.

Signal content identity includes canonical Feature IDs and Observation IDs. Both
lineages are set-like and sorted by typed ID value; tuple input order is not semantic.
The v1 Observation group is the complete canonical Observation ID set. Partial
overlap is a different group. Candidate inventory retains positive Store sequence,
exact Signal content hash, BASE/QUOTE role, group, eligibility, and one versioned
dominant rejection reason. The selection snapshot commits to the canonical complete
candidate-set hash, checkpoint, outcome, reason, and selected lineage while excluding
first-write audit `captured_at` from semantic identity. Outcome, reason, and selected
IDs are derived from the complete inventory and recomputed during intrinsic
validation; caller input is never terminal-result authority.

M2-B2 adds `0002_pair_materialization_persistence.sql`, one immutable positive
monotonic `store_sequence` per Signal, and a first-claim checkpoint equal to the
current maximum sequence. New Signal, Feature lineage, and Store entry rows commit in
one transaction. `stored_at` is local UTC Store time captured once per append; it is
not copied from `Signal.created_at`.

The migration runner applies every numbered migration body and its
`schema_migrations` marker in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. It rechecks the
marker after acquiring the writer lock, executes complete top-level SQL statements
without `executescript()` transaction ambiguity, and rolls back DDL, DML/backfill,
and marker together on any failure. Concurrent initialization therefore observes
either the complete marked migration or no part of it.

Migration backfills one Store entry per pre-0002 Signal in explicit
`signals.created_at ASC, signals.id ASC` order with `LEGACY_BACKFILL` origin. This is
a deterministic legacy catalog order, not recovered historical insertion order.
Normal append uses `APPEND`; exact M2-B4 Pair artifacts use
`PAIR_MATERIALIZATION`.

One immutable Specification and Request are stored by full-content append-or-compare.
The first Request Claim is written under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and freezes
`checkpoint_sequence` plus caller-supplied UTC `captured_at`. A retry returns that
persisted Claim even if the caller supplies a later audit time. Claim is a retry
anchor and may exist without terminal completion; it is not a selection outcome.

Before returning a checkpoint or writing/reusing a Claim, the Store validates total
catalog coverage: every Signal has exactly one Store entry, every Store entry has a
Signal, and every entry hydrates with its exact subject, supported contract/origin,
positive sequence, and UTC `stored_at`. `MAX(store_sequence)` is computed only after
that validation. A persisted Claim checkpoint must not exceed the current maximum;
every positive checkpoint must still reference one exact Store entry. Checkpoint zero
remains valid historical evidence for a first Claim over an empty Store, and later
appends do not change it.

M2-B3 candidate capture requires both
`store_sequence <= checkpoint_sequence` and `signal.created_at <= request.as_of`.
The first is the frozen local Store boundary and the second is enforced by the shared
candidate inspector. A backfilled Signal inserted after that checkpoint cannot enter
the historical Request even when its `created_at` is old.

The M2-B1 resolver groups eligible BASE/QUOTE candidates only by exact Observation
set. Multiple eligible BASE or QUOTE records inside any complete group fail the
whole Request closed before ranking. One-to-one complete groups rank by greatest
`max(base.observed_at, quote.observed_at)`, then greatest
`max(base.created_at, quote.created_at)`. If those semantic values still tie, IDs are
diagnostic ordering only and the result is `AMBIGUOUS_SOURCE_GROUP`.

`0003_pair_signal_selection_evidence.sql` stores one immutable terminal Snapshot per
Request, its complete canonical candidate inventory, and canonical Observation
ordinals. Every Signal through the persisted Claim checkpoint contributes both BASE
and QUOTE evidence, including ineligible candidates. Snapshot, candidates, and
Observation lineage are one transaction. Hydration rebuilds Signal content from the
Signal, Feature, Observation, and Store-entry tables, reruns the shared inspector and
resolver, and rejects missing, added, reordered, or altered evidence.

`SELECTED`, `NO_MATCH`, and `AMBIGUOUS` are persisted terminal Selection outcomes for
one Request, but Selection alone is not Pair artifact completion. M2-B4 adds
`0004_pair_signal_artifact_persistence.sql` and writes one immutable Completion per
Request. SELECTED atomically saves the derived Pair Signal, exact Feature/Observation
lineage, one `PAIR_MATERIALIZATION` Store entry, one `PairSignalDerivation` with
ordered Observation rows, and the Completion root last. NO_MATCH and AMBIGUOUS save
only their artifact-free Completion.

M2-B5 adds no migration, table, mutable status, or new evidence root. The operational
materializer composes the existing Claim, Selection, and Completion APIs as three
independent short transactions. Its frozen `pair-signal-materializer-result-v1`
return value groups the exact persisted Claim, Selection result, and Completion
result and validates their Request, checkpoint, capture time, outcome, and artifact
cardinality relations. Because each API commits independently, the materializer also
authenticates Claim before Selection, Selection before reading its outcome or calling
Completion, and Completion before constructing an operational outcome. A malformed
successful adapter return cannot authorize the next durable write. It fails as a
stage-labelled `SignalStoreIntegrityError`, while an exception raised by the Store
operation itself remains unwrapped. The aggregate validation remains defense in
depth; it is not persisted and does not authorize the Pair Signal.

The caller supplies one explicit Claim audit time and an optional conditional
SELECTED materialization time. Retry may supply a later Claim time or omit the
SELECTED time after Completion exists; persisted first-write times remain authority.
NO_MATCH and AMBIGUOUS never receive the conditional materialization time. Failures
remain exceptions, and retry is an explicit caller decision to replay the same
Request rather than a mutable attempt record or internal loop.
If Completion committed but an adapter returned malformed success evidence, the
materializer does not rewrite or delete that immutable transaction. A healthy replay
reauthenticates the persisted Completion and converges through
`REUSED_IDENTICAL`.

Only the first SELECTED completion accepts UTC `materialized_at`. That instant is
both Pair Signal `created_at` and Store `stored_at`; it participates in deterministic
Pair Signal identity and remains frozen on retry. Existing completion reuse hydrates
every Signal field, Feature/Observation lineage, Store origin/sequence/time,
Derivation scalar/ordered Observation evidence, and Completion reference, then reruns
the shared transformation and relational derivation verifiers. A later caller time
cannot rewrite the first result. Pair artifact rows without a Completion root are
partial corruption, not reusable evidence.
Existing `append_signal_if_absent()` retains its legacy ID-present `False` semantics
and is not exact Pair persistence: reuse of one Signal ID requires full Signal,
Feature/Observation lineage, selection, and derivation equality through
`complete_pair_signal_materialization()`. Any conflict fails without partial records.

Deterministic Pair Signal identity is fixed before transformation from exact request,
selection, BASE/QUOTE Signal IDs and content hashes, Observation group,
`currency-pair-v1`, and frozen `materialized_at`. It contains no Pair score and does
not call the transformer. Separately, `expected_pair_signal_snapshot()` reconstructs
the exact typed source Signals and calls the unchanged shared transformer.
`validate_pair_signal_transformation()` requires exact equality for every output
field and content hash. `PairSignalDerivation` owns exact ordered source Signal
lineage, and `validate_against()` must run before persistence insert/reuse and after
hydration because intrinsic content identity alone cannot prove its source relation.
Shared `Signal` remains unchanged.

Position exit semantic identity embeds one `PositionExitPositionEvidence` payload
containing the business Position ID, distinct immutable Position evidence ID, Pair,
existing Side, and opened/observed timestamps. Evaluation input must exactly match
that self-described Position/Pair/Side before identity creation. The lineage also
includes exact current Signal/Authorization/Adoption and Swap identities or explicit
absence, selection checkpoints, expected Signal specification, Adoption-state
evidence, config/policy versions, evaluation time, and outcome/reason. KEEP is
decision evidence and retains this full lineage. Ordinary close Candidate identity
embeds the same typed lineage; it is not assembled from caller-supplied strings.

`OperationalSwapEvidence` content identity continues to serialize Decimal amounts
as exact text. Only finite Decimal amounts are valid for AVAILABLE or numeric STALE
evidence; no float conversion participates in validation or identity. The supported
v1 Candidate contract, Pair transformation, and Pair Signal type are explicit config
identity dimensions and unsupported values cannot enter a valid config.

The following Paper records remain target contracts:

```text
paper_cycle_slot / paper_cycle_input_snapshot / paper_cycle_attempt
paper_order / paper_order_event
paper_fill_evaluation_plan / paper_fill_evaluation_step
paper_fill_evaluation_attempt / paper_market_observation_selection
paper_step_terminal_outcome
paper_fill
paper_position_event or paper_position_snapshot
paper_ledger_entry / paper_account_snapshot
paper_swap_evidence / paper_swap_accrual
paper_reconciliation_result
paper_burn_in_report
```

These records are append-oriented. Semantic IDs commit to canonical content and
version dimensions; audit attempt/time remains separate. Built-in `hash()` is not a
persistent identity. Current projections must be rebuildable from exact ordered
events and checked by reconciliation.

`CycleSlotId` commits to UTC `scheduled_for`, UTC `as_of`, execution-authority mode,
Strategy ID/version/config identity, and cycle-policy version. It does not include
selected input IDs. The schema must enforce one row for that semantic slot and one
`paper_cycle_input_snapshot` per slot. First claim selects and inserts the snapshot in
one transaction; a conflicting second snapshot rolls back in full.

The input snapshot records its slot/as-of, canonical ordered Currency Signal and Pair
Signal IDs, Signal Authorization and Adoption Decision IDs, Swap and cycle-time market
evidence IDs, Position snapshot/event IDs, Account snapshot ID, selection/freshness
policy versions, checkpoint identity, and `input_snapshot_hash`. The hash includes
the canonical inputs and policy versions but excludes first-write audit `captured_at`.
Retry reads this row and never reruns input selection. Late/backfilled/corrected data
cannot alter a historical slot. Each retry instead appends a `paper_cycle_attempt`
with worker/process, resumed stage, outcome/failure, and audit timestamps; none of
those fields changes the slot or input identity.

Creating a Paper order first-writes exactly one `paper_fill_evaluation_plan` for its
approved intent. A unique approved-intent reference freezes original Decimal
quantity, Pair/side, fill and Step-schedule policies, market-selection policy,
spread/slippage/liquidity/partial-fill/cancellation/expiry versions, initial and
terminal boundaries, maximum Step count, and seed root. Audit `created_at` is
preserved but excluded from semantic identity. Retry cannot insert a conflicting
second plan.

One plan owns one or more ordered `paper_fill_evaluation_step` rows. The future schema
must enforce uniqueness of `(fill_evaluation_plan_id, step_ordinal)`. Each Step stores
its contiguous ordinal, frozen market-window start/due boundary,
`remaining_quantity_before`, exact Step selection/fill versions, derived seed, and
first-write `created_at`. Step identity excludes audit time. Step 0 is initial; Step
N can exist only after Step N-1 produced a positive partial Fill, left a positive
remainder, and policy permits continuation. No ordinal skip or duplicate is allowed.

`paper_fill_evaluation_attempt` is repeatable append-only audit. A pre-due evaluation
with no eligible evidence writes `PENDING_NO_ELIGIBLE_MARKET`, eligible count,
diagnostic, worker identity, and evaluation/audit times. It neither claims nor updates
terminal Step state. Multiple PENDING attempts may exist for one Step, and a later
pre-due attempt may resolve that same Step from eligible evidence.

A Step has zero terminal resolutions while unresolved and exactly one after
resolution. The terminal variant is selected market, no-market, cancelled, or
expired. The physical schema may finalize table names in Milestone 3, but it must
provide one cross-variant unique resolution claim for `fill_evaluation_step_id`;
separate per-table unique constraints cannot permit both a selection and another
terminal outcome. Conflicting second-write fails without partial rows.

`paper_market_observation_selection` is at most one per Step and is written before
its Fill. Eligibility requires exact Pair, valid UTC timestamps, receipt inside the
frozen Step window and no later than `evaluation_due_at`, local availability by
evaluation, configured freshness, and no provider timestamp after local receipt or
the boundary. An observation selected by an earlier Step cannot be selected again.
Research `ForwardResult` is a different evidence type and cannot be referenced.
Selection is exactly:

```sql
ORDER BY received_at ASC, provider_timestamp ASC, market_observation_id ASC
LIMIT 1
```

Retry reuses the persisted selection for that Step. A newer observation may be used
only by a later Step when it satisfies that Step's frozen window; it cannot replace
an earlier selection.

`paper_step_terminal_outcome` stores versioned no-market/cancelled/expired evidence.
Under `fill-no-market-v1`, `evaluated_at < evaluation_due_at` can create only a PENDING
attempt. At/after due, absence of an observation locally received within the Step
window creates terminal `REJECTED_NO_MARKET_EVIDENCE` or the exact policy-defined
terminal code. A late-processed observation may be selected only before terminal
first-write and only when its persisted receipt proves pre-due availability. No
PENDING attempt is updated into terminal evidence, and no terminal no-market outcome
can later become a selection.

One `paper_market_observation_selection` creates at most one `paper_fill`. Fill
identity includes exact intent/plan/Step/selection, Decimal quantity and price,
spread/slippage evidence, fill/model versions, and explicit Step seed. Quantity must
satisfy `0 < fill_quantity <= remaining_quantity_before`; zero creates no Fill and
the sum of ordered Fills cannot exceed plan original quantity. Remaining quantity is
reconstructed exactly from original quantity minus persisted ordered Fills, never
from external mutable state. A positive remainder after Fill permits only the next
contiguous Step under policy. Terminal order state prevents any new Step.

Fill outputs append after the frozen cycle input and never rewrite or become that
slot's input. Research Forward Result is never Paper fill evidence.

Paper cycle/order/fill lineage persists execution authority independently from
Adoption authorization. `SHADOW_NOT_SUBMITTED` and `PAPER` both use existing
`RuntimeMode.SHADOW`; `LIVE` maps to `RuntimeMode.LIVE` only for ExecPlan 0007. No
`RuntimeMode.PAPER` row or reinterpretation of an existing authorization is required.

Paper swap evidence adds unit basis, settlement currency, source/source version,
effective period, capture time, applicable rollover date, and content identity to the
existing availability semantics. Accrual references exact position/evidence and an
accrual formula version. Missing/stale swap is a diagnostic, not numeric zero.

Paper account and PnL use `Decimal` for money, quantity, price, margin, and cash flow.
Cash, realized/unrealized PnL, accrued swap, equity, used/available margin, gross
exposure, open positions, and open orders carry exact input lineage and formula
versions.

## Live adoption records

The Live database adds numbered migrations and append-only tables for:

```text
live_research_validation_evidence_snapshots
live_strategy_adoption_policies
live_strategy_adoption_decisions
live_signal_authorizations
live_candidate_signal_authorizations
```

Evidence snapshots retain assessment/report/run IDs, Research policy version/hash and
payload, exact cohort payload/hash, opaque metric and condition payloads, Evaluation
input snapshot version/hash/payload, source contract version, Research timestamps, and
import time. Runtime never resolves these identities through a current Research
database.

Strategy adoption policy versions are immutable content identities. Reusing a version
with different content is rejected. Approvals and revocations are separate records;
revocation references one exact approval. Evidence, policy, decision, authorization,
and Candidate authorization lineage reject UPDATE and DELETE. Identical imports,
approvals, revocations, and authorizations reuse deterministic semantic identities.

## Principle

市場研究では「現在の最良値」より「当時何を知っていたか」が重要である。

そのため、Signal系データは履歴再現を優先する。

## Append-oriented records

原則append-orientedにする。

対象:

- observations
- features
- signals
- market candle revisions
- market snapshots
- forward results
- evaluations
- live decisions
- risk decisions
- execution results

修正が必要な場合は新record/versionを作る。

## Identity

IDはdomain typeで区別する。

- ObservationId
- FeatureId
- SignalId
- CandidateId
- ExecutionIntentId
- BrokerOrderId

すべてを裸の`str`としてApplication全体へ流さない。

## Version dimensions

Signal再現に関係するversionを分ける。

### producer_version

Feature生成ロジック。

### model_version

LLM/ML model identifier。

### prompt_version

構造化抽出prompt。

### scorer_version

FeatureからSignalへのscore calculation。

### transformation_version

Currency SignalからPair Signal等への変換。

### strategy_version

Signal組合せとCandidate生成。

### risk_policy_version

risk limits/policy set。

### projection_version

Signal targetを観測instrumentへ写像する規約。初期値は
`currency-usdjpy-projection-v1`。

### market_data_version

provider responseからimmutable MarketCandleへ変換するadapter/market contract。

Primary GMO FX semanticsは`gmo-fx-kline-bid-v1`、optional OANDA semanticsは
`oanda-v20-candles-v1`とする。別basisのrecordを同一versionへ入れない。

### formula_version

alignment、return、MFE/MAE、realized volatilityを含むForwardResult計算規約。
初期値は`forward-result-v1`。

バージョンを単一`app_version`だけで代用しない。

## Configuration snapshots

Live decisionでは、重要な設定を後から特定できる必要がある。

設定全文コピーまたはcontent hash + immutable config registryを用いる。

対象例:

- strategy weights
- entry threshold
- exposure limits
- freshness limit
- swap source priority

## Timestamps

UTC保存を基本とする。

表示時にtimezone変換する。

naive datetimeをdomainへ持ち込まない。

市場営業日処理、日足cutoff、swap付与日等は明示的なcalendar/time policyへ寄せる。

News ingestionでは、collectorが同じnormalized contentを最初に認識した時刻を
`first_seen_at`として固定する。Sourceが日付だけを示す場合、00:00 UTC等を補わず
`published_at=None`とし、日付文字列はResearch-owned ingestion evidenceへ保存する。

Observation IDはsource identity、canonical payload URL、normalized content hashから
決定的に生成する。同じURLの同じcontentは再保存せず、同じURLでもcontentが変化した
場合は別のimmutable Observationとする。

Feature/Signal productionでは次の順序を保証する。

```text
observation.first_seen_at
  <= feature.created_at
  <= signal.created_at
  <= production.updated_at
```

Signal時刻はFeature取得後、production時刻はSignal保存後に取得する。既存Featureを再利用
する場合は注入Clockと既存record時刻の大きい方を使い、架空の時間加算は行わない。
Featureがsource Observationより過去、または既存Signalがsource Featureより過去の場合は
recordを書き換えずproduction failureとする。

## Freshness

外部データはvalueだけでなくobserved timestampを持つ。

```text
value
source
observed_at
effective_at when known
```

RiskまたはApplication policyでstale dataを拒否できるようにする。

## Missing data

以下を区別する。

- zero
- neutral
- unknown
- unavailable
- stale
- not applicable

float `0.0`に集約しない。

Forward observationではprovider/transport/contract failureを`FAILED`、alignment window内に
complete candleがない状態を`UNAVAILABLE`として分ける。後者は
`T0_CANDLE_NOT_AVAILABLE`または`TARGET_CANDLE_NOT_AVAILABLE`を保持し、どちらもzero returnを
生成しない。

M1 alignmentのoperational readinessは`target_at + alignment delay + 1 minute`とする。
alignment終端candleがclose可能になる前はproviderを呼ばず`PENDING`を維持する。

同じopen timeでもcontentが変われば別revisionとする。Snapshotはt0からtxまで実際に使用した
complete candle revisionを順序付きで参照する。Forward jobの
`PENDING/COMPLETED/FAILED/UNAVAILABLE`はretryのためのmutable operational stateであり、
immutable evidence/result tableとは分離する。

Forward evaluation sampleの比較・集約では最低限、次のsemantic dimensionsを保持する。

```text
market_source

ExecPlan 0004は異なるdimensionを無条件に一つのheadline metricへ集約しない。

### evaluation_run

```text
run_id
evaluator_version
score_definition_version
cohort_definition_version

`evaluation_run_input`はordinal付きでexact Signal IDとForwardResult IDを参照する。一回の
SQLite read transactionでinput setを固定し、計算中に追加されたForwardResultは既存runへ
含めない。run identityはordered completed inputだけでなく、非完了job ID/statusとそのcohort、
unsupported Signal ID、incomplete-horizon Signal ID、および全configurationを含む。同じfull
snapshotとconfigurationだけが同じrunを再利用する。full snapshotはcanonical JSONとcontent
hashでappend-only保存し、診断を後からcurrent job stateで再構成しない。

`evaluation_report`はrun内のstrict cohortごとにcohort identityとversion付きmetric payloadを
保存する。cohort identityにはSignal/Forward horizon、Signal version群、market semantics、
projection/formula/score definition versionを含める。

`validation_policy`と`validation_assessment`はReportから分離する。policy versionは同じ名前で
contentを変更できず、AssessmentはEvaluation Run、Report、policy version/content hashを参照する。
Assessment保存時には参照の存在だけでなく、Reportのrun所属、persisted policy hash、および
再計算したstrict cohort/metric payloadとpersisted Reportの一致を検証する。さらに同じpure
derivationからAssessment ID、status、condition resultsを再生成し、完全一致するdecisionだけを
保存する。
run/input/report/policy/assessmentはすべてappend-onlyとし、UPDATE/DELETEを拒否する。

Evaluation metricのbootstrap version、seed、iteration count、bucket boundaries、quantilesは
configuration snapshotへ保存する。統計上のundefined、insufficient、neutral、zero return、
null MFE/MAEを同じ値へ集約しない。

## Data migration

schema migrationとsemantic migrationを区別する。

Column追加だけで既存scoreの意味が変わる場合、それはsemantic migrationである。

旧Signalを新定義へ無理に書き換えない。

旧versionを保持し、新versionとの比較をResearchで行う。
